# Therapistim

## Therapistim is a web application that helps you to find therapists in your area.

This repo is the frontend app which consumes [this](https://github.com/erennakdag/therapistim-api) backend API.

Unfortunately the website is not yet available and probably will not be in the future. I had numerous problems with hosting providers and decided to put the backend API out of production. It is mere a prototype and I am not sure if it will be useful for anyone since it relies on the fake data that I put using fakerjs :)

This project only serves as a prototype to visualize and use the backend API which was also created by me.
